Many factors affect the productivity of crops but two factors that affect crops productivity directly are,
1. Soil Conditions
2. Climate Conditions

Keeping these factors in my mind, I tried to build a Machine Learning model that will take different Climate and Soil conditions and predict a crop that can make maximum growth in these certain conditions and I did. By using this model, agronomists will be able to know which crop is more productive.

Tools and software
Python (including libraries like Pandas, matplotlib, etc.)
Jupyter notebook
Data Set
To save time, I got the data Set from Kaggle to build such a model.

Where,
N: Ratio of Nitrogen in the Soil

P: Ratio of Phosphorous in the Soil

K: Ratio of Potassium in the Soil

Temperature: Temperature in Celsius

Humidity: Relative Humidity in %

PH: Ph value for the Soil

Rain Fall: Rain Fall in 1mm
